			<p>I loved a boy once. I loved his goofy smile, which seemed to contrast his cool demeanor that he seemed to effortlessly pull off. I loved that too. Most of all, I loved the way I felt like I belonged around him, that I had a place where I could feel at peace just being me. I would have done anything to keep him in my life.</p>
<p>I remember the time when he put his hand on my leg, and I sat there petrified, silently praying for him to make a move, desperately wanting to make a move myself, rationalizing the stories I could tell my girlfriend at the time that made me seem the victim of his charm.</p>
<p>In hindsight, that moment in time was just a silly joke for him, but for me it was something more.</p>
<p>I lost him as a friend, and my life has never quite been the same.</p>
<p>And this morning, long after I thought I was over him, I dreamed of him, woke up, and was confronted again with the realization that, that was then, and this is now. and I cried.</p>
